# Introduction to SharePoint Embedded

SharePoint Embedded is provides developers a faster way to create file and document focused applications. SharePoint Embedded are powered by SharePoint. With SharePoint Embedded, developers can integrate the same powerful file and document capabilities that SharePoint has to offer in their own custom applications. In this section, you’ll learn what SharePoint Embedded is and what it offers developers creating custom applications.

For many years, users have enjoyed the document management capabilities included in SharePoint. Features like collaborating on a wide array of supported file types, securing content and managing the complete lifecycle of content and leveraging enterprise grade classification and enterprise content management (ECM) capabilities, SharePoint document management has been an industry leading solution for many years.

These capabilities have become standard across the industry to the point where Independent software vendors (ISVs) and developers have wanted to implement them in their custom solutions. Some organizations have recreated these capabilities in their products them while others have built their products on top of SharePoint.

But these solutions introduce a dependency on an entire product when what they really want is to leverage the document management features in SharePoint in their products and projects.

## Introducing SharePoint Embedded

That’s what SharePoint Embedded brings to developers. It provides a faster way for developers to create file and document focused applications. SharePoint Embedded is powered by SharePoint. Developers can integrate the same powerful file and document capabilities that SharePoint has to offer in their own custom applications.

Another way to look at SharePoint Embedded is your custom application leverages SharePoint for all document storage and collaboration features. This effectively uses SharePoint Embedded as a “headless-API” to SharePoint’s document storage system.

## App documents stay in their Microsoft 365 tenant

When a consumer installs/registers a SharePoint Embedded application in their Microsoft 365 tenant, SharePoint Embedded creates another SharePoint partition. This storage partition does not have a user interface but instead, the documents in the partition is only accessible via APIs. This means that all documents will be accessible to the ISV or developer’s application, but the documents will only reside in the consumer’s Microsoft 365 tenant.

## Consumer Microsoft 365 settings apply to app documents

All documents stored in the SharePoint partition created by the SharePoint Embedded app are in the consumer’s Microsoft 365 tenant and therefore are subject to the consumer’s Microsoft 365 tenant settings.

This includes settings from Microsoft Purview compliance, risk, and security settings, documents can be opened from Office clients, and customers can leverage the Office web clients to view and collaborate on the documents.

## Understanding the costs and billing for SharePoint Embedded content

Microsoft 365 customers have different entitlements related to storage, usage, and features depending on the licenses the customer has purchased.

The partition created in the consumer’s Microsoft 365 tenant by a SharePoint Embedded app doesn’t count towards or other Microsoft 365 entitlements. Instead, the partition in the consumer’s Microsoft 365 tenant by the SharePoint Embedded app are billed separately through an Azure subscription on a pay-as-you-go metered consumption model that’s based on total storage and the number of API calls.

## Getting started with SharePoint Embedded

SharePoint Embedded is not enabled by default on SharePoint Online tenants.

A SharePoint admin must enable SharePoint Embedded from the SharePoint admin center’s settings page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling SharePoint Embedded on a SharePoint Online tenant is a one-way operation. Once SharePoint Embedded is enabled in a SharePoint Online tenant, it can’t be disabled.
