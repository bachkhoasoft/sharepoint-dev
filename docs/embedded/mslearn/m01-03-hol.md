# Hands on Lab - Enable SharePoint Embedded in your Microsoft 365 SharePoint Online tenant

In this exercise, you’ll enable SharePoint Embedded on your Microsoft 365 SharePoint tenant.

## Prerequisites

- Access to an administrator account in a [Microsoft 365 tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program?ocid=MSlearn).

## Enable SharePoint Embedded in your Microsoft 365 SharePoint Online tenant

In order to use SharePoint Embedded to create and register Container Types, you must first enable it on your SharePoint Online tenant. This process must be done on both the provider and consuming tenants where you define your application and on any consuming tenants that will use your SharePoint Embedded app.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the same SharePoint Online tenant as both the provider/developer and consuming tenant.

Enabling SharePoint Embedded on a SharePoint Online tenant is a one-way operation; it cannot be disabled. This is to ensure any apps you’ve created on the consuming tenant will continue to function.

Once you enable SharePoint Embedded on a SharePoint Online tenant, you will be able to create a Container Type in your provider tenant and register the Container Type in a consuming tenant.

To enable SharePoint Embedded, navigate to the Microsoft 365 admin center (`https://portal.microsoft.com`) and sign-in with the **Work and School** of your Microsoft 365 tenant’s admin account.

Select **Show All** at the bottom of the left-hand navigation, then select **Admin Centers > SharePoint**.
