# Use the MSGraphClientV3 to connect to Microsoft Graph

When building SharePoint Framework solutions, you can easily connect to the Microsoft Graph by using the **MSGraphClientV3**.

## MSGraphClient overview

**MSGraphClientV3** is a new HTTP client introduced in SharePoint Framework v1.15.0 that simplifies connecting to the Microsoft Graph inside SharePoint Framework solutions. **MSGraphClientV3** wraps the [Microsoft Graph JavaScript Client Library v3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client), offering developers the same capabilities as when using the client library in other client-side solutions.

**MSGraphClientV3** replaces **MSGraphClient** which was introduced in SharePoint Framework v1.6.0. **MSGraphClient** wrapped the Microsoft Graph JavaScript Client Library v1.

While you could use the Microsoft Graph JavaScript Client Library in your solution directly, **MSGraphClientV3** handles authenticating against the Microsoft Graph for you, which allows you to focus on building your solution.

## Use the MSGraphClient in your solution

> [!NOTE]
> The **MSGraphClientV3** is available only in projects built using SharePoint Framework v1.15.0 and later. While the **MSGraphClientV3** is explained in this article by using a client-side web part, you can also use it in SharePoint Framework Extensions.

> [!NOTE]
> The single sign-on for the **MSGraphClientV3** is only available in SharePoint Online today. You can leverage the client for on premises developments but your users will be requested to sign in again within the webpart.

1. To use the **MSGraphClientV3** in your SharePoint Framework solution, add the following `import` clause in your main web part file:

    ```typescript
    import { MSGraphClientV3 } from '@microsoft/sp-http';
    ```

1. **MSGraphClientV3** is exposed through the **MSGraphClientFactory** available on the web part context. To get a reference to MSGraphClient, in your code add:

    ```typescript
    export default class HelloWorldWebPart extends BaseClientSideWebPart<IHelloWorldWebPartProps> {
      public render(): void {
        // ...

        this.context.msGraphClientFactory
          .getClient('3')
          .then((client: MSGraphClientV3): void => {
            // use MSGraphClient here
          });
      }

      // ...
    }
    ```

1. After you have the reference to the **MSGraphClientV3** instance, start communicating with the Microsoft Graph by using its JavaScript Client Library syntax:

    ```typescript
    export default class HelloWorldWebPart extends BaseClientSideWebPart<IHelloWorldWebPartProps> {
      public render(): void {
        // ...

        this.context.msGraphClientFactory
          .getClient('3')
          .then((client: MSGraphClientV3): void => {
            // get information about the current user from the Microsoft Graph
            client
              .api('/me')
              .get((error, response: any, rawResponse?: any) => {
                // handle the response
            });
          });
      }

      // ...
    }
    ```

### Use the Microsoft Graph TypeScript types

When working with the Microsoft Graph and TypeScript, you can use the [Microsoft Graph TypeScript types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types) to help you catch errors in your code faster. The Microsoft Graph TypeScript types are provided as a separate package.

1. Install the Microsoft Graph TypeScript types:

    ```console
    npm install @microsoft/microsoft-graph-types --save-dev
    ```

1. After installing the package in your project, import it to your web part file:

    ```typescript
    import * as MicrosoftGraph from '@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types';
    ```

1. Enter the objects retrieved from the Microsoft Graph, for example:

    ```typescript
    export default class HelloWorldWebPart extends BaseClientSideWebPart<IHelloWorldWebPartProps> {
      public render(): void {
        // ...

        this.context.msGraphClientFactory
          .getClient('3')
          .then((client: MSGraphClientV3): void => {
            // get information about the current user from the Microsoft Graph
            client
              .api('/me')
              .get((error: any, user: MicrosoftGraph.User, rawResponse?: any) => {
                // handle the response
            });
          });
      }

      // ...
    }
    ```

## Available permission scopes

By default, the service principal has no explicit permissions granted to access the Microsoft Graph. However, if you request an access token for the Microsoft Graph, you get a token with the `user_impersonation` permission scope that can be used for reading information about the users (that is, `User.Read.All`).

Additional permission scopes can be requested by developers and granted by tenant administrators. For more information, see [Connect to Azure AD-secured APIs in SharePoint Framework solutions](./use-aadhttpclient.md).

## Known issues

### Azure AD roles with delegated authentication

The MSGraphClient currently uses implicit authentication flow when requesting delegated permissions from Microsoft Graph.  As stated in [Microsoft identity platform access tokens](/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#payload-claims), the `wids` claim may not be present when using implicit authentication flow because of length concerns.  The `wids` claim contains the listing of Azure AD tenant-wide roles that have been assigned to the delegated user.

As a result, queries to Microsoft Graph endpoints that rely on Azure AD roles also to delegated permissions may fail because of the `wids` claim not being present.  At the time of writing this includes the following endpoints:

- [Office 365 usage reports](/graph/reportroot-authorization)
