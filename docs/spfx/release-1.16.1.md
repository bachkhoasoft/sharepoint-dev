# SharePoint Framework v1.16.1 release notes

This is a _minor bump_ that fixes the issues around SharePoint Framework solution packaging, provides improved default scaffolding and few other minor regressions which were in the previously [released 1.16 version](release-1.16.md).

**Released:** November 30, 2022

[!INCLUDE [spfx-release-notes-common](../../includes/snippets/spfx-release-notes-common.md)]

## Install the latest version

Install the latest release of the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) by including the **@latest** tag:

```console
npm install @microsoft/generator-sharepoint@next --global
```

## Upgrading projects from v1.16 to v1.16.1

In the project's **package.json** file, identify all SPFx v1.16 packages. For each SPFx package:

1. Uninstall the existing v1.16 package:

    ```console
    npm uninstall @microsoft/{spfx-package-name}@1.16
    ```

1. Install the new v1.16 package:

    ```console
    npm install @microsoft/{spfx-package-name}@latest --save --save-exact
    ```

## New features and capabilities

### Promoting `config/sass.json` file

Starting with this version, there will be a `config/sass.json` file in all  scaffolded solutions. Developers can use this file to customize or adjust the SASS task used by SPFx build routing to process SASS files. This file is not required and can be removed if not needed.
